            I am a dog lover who fell in love with this beautiful breed when I was a child in England.
            If you would like to read the story of the animals in my life please go to the My Life with Animals page.

            The golden retrievers in the above photograph are Tuppence, Shadow, Kula, Sherry and Autumn, with Phoenix laying
            down in front. Unfortunately our dear sweet Phoenix passed over the Rainbow Bridge in September 2016 at the ripe
            old age of 14 years, 8 months. However, she is still very much in our hearts and minds and it is very hard to think
            about the fact that she is no longer with us. My website will still tell the story of Phoenix because she was the
            most beautiful first golden for me to own and was the reason I wanted to have more of them. I can't thank her enough
            for the lessons she taught me and the loyalty only a dog can give even when the human is less than perfect.
