            Then in December 2001 Pepper went off her food. She was the sort of dog that ate ravenously. It didn’t matter how
            much food was in her bowl, it all went within about 10 seconds, and heaven help anyone who got near. I had tried
            over the years to get her to let me stroke her while she was eating or to move the bowl. I did have some success
            but would never have trusted her with the kids so guarded her while she ate – which didn’t take much time out of
            my day due to the speed of this process! I can’t tell you how scary it is to have an animal that you love start to
            get sick and for there to seem to be nothing you can do about it. For the previous two winters, Pepper had been
            allowed to sleep inside every night as my conscience had been getting to me and I had started to think that there
            was a better way to look after this dog at home. I also had her in the lounge during the day when the kids weren’t
            around and the weather was bad.

            None of this prepared me for what was about to happen. I took Pepper to the vet and he did the usual process ...
            antibiotics first ... when that didn’t work he took blood tests ... when those came back with slight abnormalities
            he did another blood test. Pepper and I would walk down the vet and she would stop at the door to the vet in the
            morning and I remember thinking that this beautiful creature has no idea that this place is possibly going to be
            where she ends her life one day. All the days that these tests were taking, Pepper wasn’t eating. I tried everything
            that I could think of. She certainly wasn’t eating her dried dog food. For a while she nibbled a bit of wet food. I
            would offer her some of our tea, I would buy things for her to try, but mostly to no avail. I was watching this
            lovely, active but slim dog become even slimmer.

            We went through Christmas that year with a bit of a struggle. We usually bought Pepper some doggie choc drops for
            Christmas, but this year she opened her present but wasn’t interested in eating. I was worried sick about her. The
            final blood test that she had showed the possibility of something wrong with the liver. One day the vet talked to
            me about the fact that if Pepper wasn’t eating, she would probably die and that while she seemed ok she could go on
            but there could be a time when it would be best to put her to sleep to speed up the inevitable. I talked to him
            about what else could be done. The fact was that at that time, Pepper was still enjoying walks and seemed quite
            energetic. I still to this day don’t know how she managed that with the tiny amount of food that she had had for a
            couple of weeks. The vet said that he could do a biopsy on the liver to see what was wrong with the hope that he
            would be able to find a cure. We were lucky at this time that we were in a position to try anything to save Pepper.
            So we agreed that she would go in for the biopsy on Monday.

            That weekend Rob and I took Pepper to her favourite walks. We walked down the river and she gambolled along in front
            of us. Probably not quite as racey as normal, but still enjoying it. We sat down on the grass and played with her
            and just sat and enjoyed the togetherness.

            But of course the good time had to end and Monday morning came. Once again, Pepper walked happily to the vet and
            waited at the door to be let in. I said goodbye and left her there for the day. The vet called later to say the
            biopsy had gone ok and was to be sent off and I could pick her up after 4pm. Well, who knows whether I would have
            done this if I had known what was going to happen, or whether I would have just let Pepper get to the point where
            we just put her to sleep without putting her through this operation. We can always have regrets in hindsight and
            wish for time to be turned back to see if another route would prove to be better. However, I made my choice and this
            is what happened to my beautiful Pepper....

            Having not eaten for quite a while, the anaesthetic hit her pretty hard. She was so groggy all evening and couldn’t
            really move. I remember coaxing her for a short walk up the road in the evening to see if she wanted to relieve
            herself, but she didn’t. We literally only staggered two houses up the street and back. I thought she would enjoy
            being out in the air.

            She had a bed right by my side of the bed so I could keep an eye on her. We had visitors staying that night – in the
            lounge – so my life was a bit of an upheaval at that time. But I checked on Pepper every few moments it felt like.
            It was the worst night of my life. I went to bed and Pepper, who was laying down would then struggle up and just
            stand. I would stroke her head and try and get her to lay down again but she just wanted to stand. She must have
            felt so awful, probably in a lot of pain, but such a quiet, docile animal here. This dog who loved nothing more than
            to run and run, standing by my bed with her head down. I was awake all night with her, just stroking her head. The
            longest night of my life. As soon as it was morning I got up to look at her. She was laying down at that stage and
            I know I knew... you know... that time that you dread, that time that you know you have to be God. She was laying
            on the blanket and the wound in her tummy was oozing slightly with blood. I had to get her to the vet. They don’t
            answer the phone until 8am, but I knew that the vet was usually there at 7.30am. I told Rob I needed to take her
            immediately. We carried her to the car and laid her in the back and I went to the vet. I had never done anything
            like this before and my mind was in a spin with a huge cloud over it. I was so relieved that the vet was there and
            he came to the car and looked at her. Her gums were totally yellow and he said that her liver had stopped working.
            We carried her into the surgery, laid her on the table and there I stroked her beautiful head and talked to her
            while she slipped from this world to a happier place.
        </p>
        <p>
            I took her home and once our visitors had gone, we all said goodbye to Pepper and Rob buried her in the garden
            along with all our other “friends”. That was a hard day. The boys and we all put something special into that grave
            for Pepper to take with her – treats, ball, stick and a blanket to keep her warm. At least I got to say goodbye to
            this dog and to tell her I loved her.

            Pepper gave me something very special. She was my first dog and I made what I consider to be mistakes with her.
            The main thing I feel I failed on was that I didn’t keep her in the house with us as part of the family. This was
            on my conscience as time went on and was why for the last couple of years she had spent more time in the house.
            However, I felt I needed to make amends.
