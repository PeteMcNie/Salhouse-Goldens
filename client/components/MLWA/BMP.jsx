            <p>
              Of course, I have had some good office jobs over the years, but in reality, none are as rewarding as working with
              animals. I had been to New Zealand a couple of times and met a man that I was to marry, Rob. We got married in
              England and stayed there for about three years before coming to New Zealand to live. I was pregnant with my first
              child, Nigel, when we left England. We stayed with my brother briefly before getting ourselves a flat. I wanted to
              have a pet of my own still, but we were not allowed pets in the flat. However, we did a really naughty thing and
              purchased a budgie, called Budgie! He was with us for a while but ended up with some kind of problem where he lost
              all his feathers and died.

              At this stage we had two babies and were looking for a house of our own. We found one and moved in. I was so excited
              to at long last have a house of my own where I could have pets if I wanted that on the day that we moved in, once the
              main move was completed, we made a dash into Wellington to the SPCA to get a kitten. We found a lovely little
              chocolate-coloured tortoiseshell kitten and took her home with us.
            </p>
            <p>
              We called her Maddie and she was a cutie. She grew up with our kids and was never any trouble. She was always at
              the gate waiting for us to come home. She did spend the days in or outdoors, whatever she wanted, but I always left
              her outside at night. I don’t know that I knew a lot about cats and I thought they were night hunters and would like
              to be outside at night. In hindsight, I feel a bit sorry now that I shut her out most nights (although not all) as
              I see other cats that are happy to be curled up snug and warm at night. Also I wouldn’t let her in the whole house.
              She was allowed in the kitchen, dining, conservatory and lounge, but not the bedrooms.

              When she was a kitten, we had the three vaccinations done but then nothing after that. She was always healthy and as
              she never went into a cattery, I didn’t think she needed vaccinating. However, when she was 15 I started to think
              (and I wish I didn’t think so much) that it might be a good idea to have her vaccinated as she was getting older.
              She was the sort of cat that didn’t really show her age. She looked the same at 15 as she did at one. She didn’t have
              any grey hairs and she always only ever weighed two kilos, not a big cat. So I got her vaccinated. Three months later
              she was dead. I can’t help thinking that if I had not had her vaccinated she would have been alright. Its probably ok
              to vaccinate if you have vaccinated them all their life, but for me to have got her done when she hadn’t had a
              vaccination since a kitten was probably too much for her. One evening, Nigel was sitting next to me on the couch and
              we were watching t.v. together. He was 17 years old. Maddie jumped up on his lap and curled up to sleep. Then all of
              a sudden she made a strange noise like the sucking in of breath quite loudly and she moved, then was still. Nigel
              thought she had just sneezed but I thought there was something wrong and touched her. I said I thought she was dead -
              and sure enough she was. She had just jumped up on his lap, curled up to sleep and died. Poor Nigel was gutted but I
              believe and have always told him that it was an honour for him as she chose him to be the last place to live.

            <p>
              We had three boys by this time and when I was at home I decided that it would be good to finally have a dog. I wanted
              a Golden Retriever but was probably very naïve and didn’t know about contacting breeders etc. I thought you just
              looked in pet shops for dogs. So I started to look but there were never any Goldens. The dogs were all cross-breeds
              and one day I went into the pet centre and found a puppy that I thought was quite cute. I took Rob along to have a
              look and he, being the easy-going fellow that he is, was quite happy to purchase this dog.
            </p>
            <p>
              So it was that Pepper came into our lives. She was a real cross-breed, probably German Shepherd/Labrador mostly, but
              the speed that she had made the vet think that she possibly had some greyhound in her too. I remember the day I brought
              her home from the shop - she was this little pot-bellied puppy. But then she had a pooh, and I couldn’t believe my eyes
              – it was full of worms – ugh. So of course we got that fixed pretty quickly and she wasn’t such a pot-bellied puppy after
              that.

              Rob was a farmer’s son and so having dogs at the farm meant that they were housed outside. Pepper was kept in the kitchen
              as a puppy, but as she grew up we made a kennel for her and she was kept outside. She would have the run of the whole
              garden when we were at home, but when we were out we chained her to the kennel as we didn’t have any way of preventing
              her going to the front gate. We didn’t have a lot of money, three young children to keep and most things were pretty
              basic. Pepper seemed to be a happy dog but didn’t tolerate children too well. If they went to touch her she would
              occasionally nip them. This made taking her out to the park to watch soccer every week a bit difficult because kids would
              want to come and stroke her and I would have to have one eye on the soccer and one eye on Pepper to make sure that no-one
              came to her. She didn’t ever nip someone else’s kids as I was so vigilant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pepper was only allowed in our house in the evening and then she had to lay on a rug in the lounge. I wouldn’t let her
              anywhere else in the house. She used to go back outside for the night. However, as time went on I started to feel guilty
              about keeping this dog outside. I began to think about the fact that Lassie had been an indoor dog. I persuaded Rob to
              let me let Pepper inside if it was really bad weather or cold. She would sleep on a blanket outside our bedroom door and
              I had to say that compared with my Goldens, she was the quietest thing. My Goldens snore, dream and grunt when they thunk
              down heavily. Pepper wasn’t like that at all.

              I used to walk her for miles. She was an exceedingly fast and energetic dog.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the end, to wear her out Rob would drop me and my bike and Pepper at Moonshine Park in Upper Hutt and I would bike down
              by the river all the way back home with Pepper running alongside. When we got home, Pepper would still be full of running
              and I would be knackered! However, it did mean that she was a bit quieter for a couple of days after that. I became fixated
              with walking this dog. I used to love to take her out. There is nothing more special than going for a walk in the bush or
              even just round a park and having this creature running with joy in front, behind, beside you, picking up any messages that
              other dogs have left and generally enjoying themselves. It is very therapeutic.
