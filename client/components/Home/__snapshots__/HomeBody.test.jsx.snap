            Welcome to Salhouse Golden Retrievers
          </h2>
          <p>
            I am a dog lover who fell in love with this beautiful breed when I was a child in England. If you would like to read the story of the animals in my life please visit the

              My Life with Animals
            </a>
             page.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have had the privilege of sharing the lives of seven beautiful Golden Retrievers, most of whom are shown in the photos at the top of this page. Phoenix was my first Golden, and was the reason I wanted to have more of them. I can't thank her enough for the lessons she taught me and the loyalty only a dog can give even when the human is less than perfect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kula was born in 2003 and was a really loving gentle dog. She was a great retriever, loving nothing more than to swim in the river or sea fetching as many sticks as we can throw for her. In 2007, Kula had a beautiful litter of puppies and we kept one female who we named Shadow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shadow is a real character and is such fun to be with. She is so enthusiastic about her people and has the loveliest nature. Shadow had a litter of 7 puppies in April 2010 and we have kept one of those, Sherry. We added an item to the News page each day from the day the puppies were born to the time they left us. There are loads of photos and videos of these puppies and some stories of them growing up. Go to the News page to see these stories and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sherry is a very soft Golden, only wanting to please and be with us. She is a beautiful natured member of our family and dabbled in obedience for a while and did quite well. Sherry had a litter of two female puppies on 16 June 2015 - Autumn and Tuppence. Only having two in the litter made it impossible for us to part with one, so, although we had only wanted to keep one, we found ourselves with the two naughties!
          </p>
          <p>
            Tuppence is the smaller of the two sisters, but she is an exceedingly easy dog to train. She’s been taught lots of tricks and is a thinker. If you give her the right messages, she will eventually work out what you want her to do. She goes through her whole repertoire of tricks until she finds the one you want. I’ve never had a thinking dog like this before and she’s been really fun to train.
          </p>
          <p>
            Autumn is a relatively strong and powerful Golden girl, whose enthusiasm is very contagious and can be hard to contain when she’s out near water or when we’ve got a ball thrower. She is totally focused. Autumn had a litter of seven puppies in March 2019, of which we kept one who we called Siren.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siren is a darling. She’s a very showy girl and looks beautiful in the show ring and when out and about with her head up and tail flowing. She’s got a zany character and is another fun dog to be around.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to find out more about each of these beautiful dogs, please go to their pages to learn more. Shadow, Sherry and Autumn are breed champions. Sherry did compete in championship obedience competitions up to Test A level and has gained the CDX title. However, when Autumn and Tuppence came along it was too much to continue training Sherry and the puppies and so she is retired from the obedience ring. Tuppence is a very smart dog and at the present time is in training and hopefully one day I will get her into the obedience ring. Go to their individual pages to learn more about them.

            Goldens are wonderful pets - they are loyal, friendly and good with children . I hope you like mine and get your own one day!
