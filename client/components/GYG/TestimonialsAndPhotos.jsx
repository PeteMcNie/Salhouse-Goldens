        <p>Missy after groom:</p>
        <p>
            It was so lovely meeting you and thank you so much for grooming her today! She looks so amazing thanks to you! This is
            probably the best she&apos;s ever looked after a groom so I&apos;m really thankful for your great service. I think she really
            enjoyed it also, and meeting your lovely goldens too! Thank you so much for the photos! It&apos;s evident that she really
            enjoyed being groomed by you. She looks so cute! Definitely having her groomed with you again if you would be happy to
            have her again sometime next year. I really appreciate your wonderful work. - Celina
