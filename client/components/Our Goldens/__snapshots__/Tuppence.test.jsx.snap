      At the time of writing this Tuppence is just 20 months old. She is not a show dog but a beautiful, happy family dog. She is a supporter at shows to her sister, mum and grandma who still occasionally shows at 11 years of age. Tuppence is the smartest dog I have ever owned. She has got heaps of enthusiasm and picks up new tricks really easily. Her biggest drawback is the ability of her trainer, me! In February 2017 I took her to a trick workshop one Saturday. The other dogs that went had been trained at the facility previously. The only training Tuppence had done was the training that I have done with her throughout her life. It is extensive training but doing in on your own makes it quite interesting as you're never quite sure how well you're doing. Anyway, we had to achieve 15 points doing up to 15 tricks to gain a certificate and a ribbon at this workshop. Tuppence flew through the tricks. That's how smart this little dog is. She has the most beautiful smile and is such an enthusiastic puppy.
