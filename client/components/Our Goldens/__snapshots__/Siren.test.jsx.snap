      Meet the beautiful Siren, who also has the nickname Naughty Pants. She came into our lives in March 2019 being the second puppy born to Autumn. Right from the start I did not want this puppy. She screamed for the first two days of her life, hence the name, and she is the wrong colour for me. I prefer the more golden ones. But throughout the eight weeks that we had the litter at home starting their lives, Siren kept on standing out by either doing something or glowing or standing out from the crowd. She was a bit of a loner. In the last couple of weeks when we had the puppies, when we called them to us, they would all come rushing over... all except one, Siren. She would just sit back and watch, not wanting to be in the melee of the other puppies.
    </p>

      Siren has had a good start to her show career, being lightly shown in her first year. She has achieved a couple of group wins, and in her last show before the Covid-19 lockdown, she achieved a Best Puppy In Show award. Absolutely brilliant!
