      Autumn's Litter 2006
    </h2>
    <p>
      On 26 March 2019, Autumn had a litter of seven beautiful puppies. We gave them all names shortly after they were born - Puzzle, Siren, Eros, Tuddly, Star, Crumble and Toffee. We had a lot of fun with this litter, playing with them and watching them grow. Six of them went to lovely families, and one naughty one, Siren (aka Naughty Pants) stayed with us.

      On this page are just a handful of the hundreds of photos that we took of these lovely puppies in the first eight weeks of their lives.
