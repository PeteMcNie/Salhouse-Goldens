              <p>7 April 2010 - present</p>
              <p>
                Sherry came into our family on the 7th of April, 2010. You can learn about the puppies in that litter
                <a href='/shadow'> here.</a> Sherry is a very sweet Golden Retriever puppy who was chosen for her friendly,
                gentle nature, waggy tail and, hopefully, suitability to be a show dog. As a puppy, she was quick to learn,
                and at 10 weeks of age could sit, down, wait, stand and come to command. However, she couldn&apos;t let go of her
                mother&apos;s leg when called so that took a bit more training!
              </p>
              <p>
                At 17 weeks of age, Sherry was enjoying life to the full. She had learnt to swim and loved running around on the beach.
                She was a real retriever as she always brings us something in her mouth when she comes to see us - either a slipper,
                sock, toy, anything. One day I even dropped a birthday card on the floor and she picked it up and gave it to me!
                Sherry achieved some successes as Baby Puppy in Breed at four-and-a-half months old, she went to the Auckland
                Golden Retriever shows and won Baby Puppy in Show at both shows. Critique for one of the shows was: Good size
                young lady, sweetest of heads, good pigment, kind eye, well angulated at front and rear, dead level topline,
                has good overall balance, moved out well for one so young, shows good promise. Sherry then moved on to Puppy
                class and had one or two successes at the end of 2010. In Hastings in early December she won two Puppy of Breeds.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sherry also continued her own wonderful personality. One of her most endearing traits is that she always has
                something in her mouth when she comes to see you. If she is rushing up to greet you and doesn&apos;t have anything
                in her mouth she stops dead, and you can see the thought processes - nothing in mouth, must get something to
                bring as a gift! So sweet. That developed over a while to Sherry becoming my slipper fetcher, and whenever I
                come in from being outside, she races off (without being asked) to find my slippers and bring them to me.
                That is one of the best things I reckon you can teach a dog to do.
              </p>
              <p>
                She also took up putting her nose in everything, although she denies it of course (see photos below).
                I took it upon myself to try and learn to compete in obedience competitions with Sherry. I was a total novice,
                and Sherry was my training companion. We did okay for a team that didn&apos;t really know the first thing about
                obedience. Sherry got through winning out of the Special Beginners&apos; class, and then won out of Novice class.
                She was partway through winning out of Test A, but then life got busy and I lost the enthusiasm and I decided
                to retire her. However, before I retired her, she went for an obedience title called CDX, and she got it, which
                is why she has those letters behind her registered name now. I am very proud of the obedience that we did do
                together, and to this day she will practice with me in the garden or out in the street if I decide to have a
                trip down memory lane.

                In March 2014, two weeks after her mum, Shadow, became a breed Champion at Wanganui, we set off for four more
                shows at Hastings. The weather was lovely, the company was great, and the mood seemed good. On Saturday morning
                we went into the show ring and Sherry got into the line up. She was running really nicely and the judge looked
                and looked and all of a sudden pointed to Sherry for the challenge! It took a moment to dawn on me... we have
                finally made another Champion... yeah! What excitement that was. We were on Cloud 9. We had a lovely boozy shout
                at lunch time to celebrate our success with friends who have supported us throughout the years we have been
                showing. It was a really nice time and something I won&apos;t forget. To top the weekend off, on the Sunday Shadow
                took the challenge in the morning show and Sherry took another challenge in the afternoon show - so what a
                great effort that was from both the girls. We didn&apos;t get home till after 9pm that day! Sherry now has the CH
                in front of her registered name to show she is a breed Champion.

                Sherry had a litter of puppies in June 2015. However, calling it a litter
                was a bit of an overstatement! We had two female puppies. There was a third puppy, a boy, but that one unfortunately
                passed away at birth. The birth was not a pleasant experience for Sherry, and it is a good reminder to us and
                perhaps anyone wanting a puppy, that when a breeder decides to breed their dogs, it doesn&apos;t always go well and
                they are putting their loved furry family at risk. We can&apos;t know the outcome of a mating and birth. We just hope
                that we have got it right and that things will go well. Sherry had trouble having the first puppy. We ended up at
                the vet and to say that I never want to go through something like that again would be an understatement. The puppy
                had to come out and Sherry screamed for a long time until we could get the puppy out. It was heart-breaking. I
                promised Sherry that I would not do that to her again. She had the other two puppies naturally and was a lovely
                mother, although answering the door was always more important to her than staying in with her puppies. Autumn and
                Tuppence were born and we couldnâ€™t just give one of them away, so the decision was made to keep both of them.
                Sherry has been a faithful companion for many years now, and at the time of writing this, she is 10 years old and
                still wants to please us. She is a happy, smiley Golden and we hope she keeps us company and brings me my slippers
                for a good many more years.
