              When Shadow was a puppy, along with the six other littermates, we used to visit the puppies outside in the
              garden but then come in through either the conservatory door or through the gate at the side. Invariably
              one puppy used to slip through onto our side of the door/gate once we had closed it and we began to realise
              that it was always the same one. This same puppy used to follow my husband around as well and consequently
              she became the beautiful puppy that joined our family. She was named “Shadow“ because my husband considered
              she shadowed him all the time.
            </p>

              Shadow has the most wonderful personality. She plays hide and seek, is always mischievous in a nice way, and
              she talks to us. She can be quite vocal when greeting people she knows, not barking, but almost squealing her
              delight at the meeting. She also is the most wonderful cuddler in the world. I have never known a dog to cuddle
              the way she does. She knows just how to get in the right place and hold on to you in such a lovely way. You
              cannot sit or lay on the floor in our house without Shadow commandeering a cuddle. Kula is also a cuddler,
              but she doesn&apos;t stand much of a chance with Shadow around as Shadow will always get in between her Mum and
              whichever human is on the floor.

              Shadow whelped a litter of seven puppies on 7 April 2010. There is a link above called Shadow&apos;s litter
              where there are photos of this lovely litter of four male and three female puppies. One of the female puppies
              from this litter joined our family and we have named her Sherry. You can find out more about her on her own page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shadow is our first show dog, competing in breed shows. I had to learn how to do the show thing and took
              her to training in Porirua every week. They have a ribbon parade once a month, and I was very chuffed when
              she won Best On Parade one time. She was seriously shown in championship shows and won her first Challenge
              Certificate at Hastings on 11 December 2010.

              Who would have thought that a visit to Whanganui would be a really amazingly exciting event! Whanganui will
              go down in history for us as the scene of our greatest achievement so far. On 14 March 2014, we set out from
              Lower Hutt to attend four dog shows that weekend. We had Shadow sitting on six Challenge Certificates and
              Sherry sitting on seven Challenge Certificates (not literally sitting, you know what I mean!). A dog needs
              eight Challenge Certificates to be able to be called a Champion. We have been showing Shadow for around
              five-and-a-half years. We don&apos;t go to shows every weekend, but we have trundled around the country, even
              around the South Island, and picked up challenges here and there.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Saturday 15 March 2014, we went into the ring for the first show late morning. Blow me down if I didn&apos;t
              get both Shadow and Sherry in the line-up for the first challenge - which means they both won their classes
              and are then put up to be assessed against all the other bitches who have won their classes. Whoever wins
              that line up wins the bitch challenge. Well, dear Shadow won that challenge. That made our weekend already
              and we went back to our camp spot quite happy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next up was the gundog show in the afternoon. We set off to the ringside again and entered the ring for a
              run around. Well blow me down if we didn&apos;t get them both into the line-up yet again. So I had two dogs in
              the ring who could possibly become Champions. We waited for the judge to look them over and ran them around.
              And then... SHADOW you did it again, became Salhouse&apos;s very first official Champion! Woo hoo... so happy.
              What a weekend. Just to show that it wasn&apos;t a fluke, Shadow picked up the first challenge of the day on
              Sunday too. Way to go my girl.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shadow still amazes me. She&apos;s never really changed, except she’s a little quieter now she&apos;s an old lady
              and doesn&apos;t sing to visitors much because she doesn&apos;t hear them come in the door. However, at fourteen-
              and-a-half years old, she still walks everywhere with us, even going to the south island for a holiday
              with us and walking the hills around Alexandra and also doing the 12.5km walk from Alexandra to Clyde,
              swimming in the Clutha River lots of times along the way.
