      &lt;h2&gt;About Us&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;What we are about&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
          I am an animal lover and in particular I love my dogs. I dabbled in agility with Phoenix in the past and I started breed
          showing a little bit  with mainly Shadow and occasionally Kula. I do compete in breed showing quite a bit now with Sherry
          and Autumn and sometimes Shadow. I do it mainly  I have found that I have a very loving, friendly type of dog that I can
          have fun with. I decided that I would like to breed from Kula&amp;apos;s line and hopefully continue with my own dog family. I do
          enjoy going away to shows and the social life with that and having a very occasional litter if I want a puppy. I have picked
          dogs that I think have lovely natures and also look very nice. All the goldens are checked for general health, tested for
          hip, elbow and eyes. These can be the main problems for a large breed dog. Although there can be no guarantees for the health
          of a puppy, the best endeavour is made to produce lovely healthy family dogs.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
          There are some pretty good obedience dogs in the background also and therefore anyone wanting to do obedience with their dog
          would probably do alright. I am thinking of taking this up. My biggest problem is sorting myself out as I have trouble knowing
          left from right. If I am nervous my brain goes to pot. I have to make sure I have my watch on so that I know which way is left!
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
          You will see from some of the lovely photos on this website, we spend a lot of time walking our dogs. We like to explore different
          walks near to home or far away and are lucky enough to have access to many walking tracks.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;hr /&gt;
      &lt;h3 id='salhouse' className='belowNavbar'&gt;Where &amp;apos;Salhouse&amp;apos; comes from&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
          When I was a child we used to go for boating holidays on the Norfolk Broads in Norfolk, England. These were happy days and
          there was one Broad called Salhouse Broad that I can remember we had great fun at. It was a beautiful Broad and we moored
          there for the night and got up to all sorts of mischief, jumping off the boat into the water, playing on the shore - cricket,
          football, climbing trees etc. Anyway, when I was wanting to get a name for my kennel I decided I wanted a name that my Dad
          (who has since passed away) would recognise and something that meant happy times with him to me. I went through a lot of
          names and in fact could have picked any of them, but in the end I decided on Salhouse which will forever remind me of my Dad
          and my happy holidays on the Broads.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
          The litter of puppies that Kula had in 2006 all were given pedigree names of cruisers that were on the Norfolk Broads with the
          word &amp;ldquo;Sun&amp;ldquo; in them. Hence, Salhouse Sunchaser, Sundancer, Sunburst etc.  We have continued on with this tradition with Shadow&amp;apos;s
          litter naming them Golden Light at Salhouse, Prince of Light at Salhouse, etc.
      &lt;/p&gt;
