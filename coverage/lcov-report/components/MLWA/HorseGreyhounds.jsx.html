      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Horses&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            In the meantime, when I wasn&amp;apos;t walking Lassie, I was always up the local stables riding the horses, mucking out
            and as I got older, teaching other people to ride. I broke my arm while riding on the South Downs one day. We were
            in a field near Cissbury Ring - the furthest away from the stables that this particular 1 hour ride would go, on a
            Saturday afternoon. While we were walking through the field some idiots let off a gun to shoot at the pheasants.
            Well, the whole ride took off at a flat out gallop. I was only 9 years old at the time and I was riding the fastest
            pony that we had. His name was Dr Zhivago and he was very strong. The horses were all galloping on the very hard
            ground as it was middle of summer. The Downs are made of chalk and it is not very pleasant to land on. Zhivago was
            going flat out and I dropped one rein and pulled his head round and even put my fingers through the ring of the bit
            but I couldn&amp;apos;t slow him down. We were coming to a very sharp bend in the track and at the speed we were going I
            thought he was going to go down and probably fall on top of me and so I made the decision to get off at full speed
            gallop. Of course, in hindsight I should perhaps have stayed with him, but then worse could have happened if he did
            fall at the corner. I took my feet out of the stirrups as I didn&amp;apos;t want to be caught up in them and then got off -
            no easy feat when the horse is going so fast. I hit the ground and I remember putting my head up and hearing the
            thunder of feet, so I put my head down again while another horse galloped on past me (remember that there were
            probably 20 horses bolting as fast as they could at this stage). Then everything went quiet and I waited. I got up
            and suddenly realised that my watch on my left arm was in the middle of a very big dip in my wrist. I had broken it.
            I also had a small stone lodged in the corner of one of my eyes, probably when my head hit the ground. I started to
            walk back to the stables with one of the other ladies who had stopped her horse and was picked up by a farmer part
            way down the track and bounced very uncomfortably down the track to his house where he called my parents. Apart from
            that one accident, working with horses was great fun and allowed me to be around animals even more which was all I
            wanted.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;Image src="images/topper.jpg" fluid /&gt;
        &lt;hr /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Greyhounds&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Once I finished school I started work at a racing greyhound kennel in the Sussex countryside. My Dad got me the job,
            so although he hadn&amp;apos;t seemed to actively promote my love of animals, he was responsible for helping me start my
            working life with them. This was probably more because he was a betting man and loved to go to horse racing at
            Fontwell Park and the greyhound racing at Brighton. This gave him an excuse to go to lots of greyhound meetings
            because he would have to come and pick me up at the kennels after a race night, so he and Mum used to come to the
            meetings when I was working. Not only that, but he became friendly with the trainer I worked with, George Curtis,
            and George would give him a tip for a bet each night.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I used to work one or two nights a week. On work days I would start out from home at 6am and walk to the station,
            catch the train to Portslade, wait on the corner of the road for a van to come and pick me up along with all the
            other kennel hands and then drive to the kennels for work at around 8am. On a day when I was working the evening
            race meeting, we would stay at the kennels after 4pm which was our usual finish time and wait until it was time to
            load up all those dogs that were going to be racing and then get in the back of the lorry with the dogs and travel
            to the stadium. We would then have to unload all the dogs, walk them round to get a urine test, weigh them in and
            put them in their kennel. Then we would have a meal and then start the evening&amp;apos;s racing. We would have to get each
            dog out of the kennel for its race, have it identified, put a jacket on it and then see it off to the race. Some
            nights I would work as a walker, walking the dogs on the track in front of the crowd and then putting my runner
            in the trap ready for the race. Then we would have to run to the other side of the track where the finish was and
            catch our dog. On days where I worked the evening race meeting, we wouldn&amp;apos;t finish until about 11.30pm and by the
            time we drove home it would be past midnight. Quite hard if I was working again the next day and had to be up
            before 6am.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;Image src="images/clountieComment.jpg" fluid /&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Pictured left is me with one of the greyhounds, a female whose racing name was Clountie Comment. I can&amp;apos;t recall
              her kennel name.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Those were good, fun days. I learned to love greyhounds as much as any other dog. They don’t look that cuddly, but
            in fact they can be. I used to sit in the kennels with them sometimes when we were waiting for something to happen.
            They all had their own personalities and most loved contact with people. They make lovely pets. I had a particular
            favourite called Deneholme Deluxe. His kennel name was Sam. He was a cheeky dog and obviously just to my liking as
            I had a special bond with him. However, he wasn’t the best racing dog and his owners knew I liked him and I can recall
            some suggestion that I might like him as a pet. But I couldn’t do that as my Dad wouldn’t let me so he was sent to
            Portsmouth to run there. I don’t know what happened to him in the end. I hope that he finished his racing career and
            found someone to give him a lovely home for the rest of his life.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I had a couple of stints of working with the greyhounds, but eventually I had to give it up as I got such bad hayfever
            that my doctor warned that I might start to get asthma if I continued working with them. The kennels were in the middle
            of the Sussex countryside and in June and July I could hardly breathe every day. I would sneeze my way through the day
            and twice my Dad had to come and pick me up and take me home because I had collapsed. So I gave up the dogs and started
            the boring and unsatisfying career of working in offices.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;hr /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
