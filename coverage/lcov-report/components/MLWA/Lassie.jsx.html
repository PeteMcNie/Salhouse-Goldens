      &lt;h3&gt;Lassie&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
            What I really wanted was a dog, but my Dad was never going to allow that. I knew that there was an elderly couple
            across the road from us who owned a beautiful dog. I had seen them walking her up the road. She was only young and
            I was five years old and I decided to ask them if I could take their dog for a walk. My heart was in my mouth as I
            walked up to their front door and knocked on it, feeling so small and not knowing what they were going to say. I
            couldn’t believe my luck when they said they were happy for me to take her for a walk. Her name was Lassie, and this
            was the start of a beautiful friendship and the beginning of my love of Golden Retrievers. Below is the only photo I
            have of Lassie.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;Image src="images/lassie.jpg" fluid /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
            Lassie was not actually a purebred Golden Retriever, but a Saluki/Golden Retriever cross. She had the build of a Golden
            and the beautiful golden colouring, but her feathers were very long, more like a Saluki. I have to give thanks to Claude
            and Dorothy (Lassie’s owners) for allowing me the chance to walk their dog – I know that if a 5-year old child came to
            me to ask if they could walk one of my dogs I would say no.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
            As I grew up I did everything with Lassie. I walked her after school every day, took her out for whole day walks at the
            weekend, sometimes to the beach, sometimes up the South Downs. We would get lost and walk miles but eventually find our
            way home. Claude and Dorothy had a grand-daughter, Alison, who used to come and visit with her parents about one Sunday
            every month. I used to sit at the lounge window and hope every Sunday that this would be the day they arrived, and when
            they did, Alison and I went for hikes even further. Alison was more of a tom boy and daredevil than I was and I enjoyed
            her company. She had two Jack Russells and so we would go walking with the three dogs. I used to love having Lassie or one
            of the Jack Russells on a lead walking round the streets. I can’t explain the feeling, it was like being privileged to
            have this dog trotting along with me. When we got to the beach, park or Downs the dogs would be let off the lead and we
            would go wandering, in the bush, sometimes through a field that we knew we shouldn’t be going through with a dog – what if
            the farmer saw us? We used to walk in the snow as well in winter. I remember that Lassie had a lot of fur between her toes
            and under her paws. When we walked up the Downs in the snow, ice balls would form in the fur under her paws and I would
            have to stop every so often to break the ice up and pull it off the fur. Then we would carry on for a bit longer until I
            had to do it again. We went far and wide and had some great adventures.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
            I think one of the greatest thing about dogs is the fact that they are so happy to see you. Every day that I went to Claude
            and Dorothy’s to take Lassie out, she would go wild with excitement seeing me. Claude used to take Lassie out a couple of
            times a day, but these were more sedate walks and I like to think that she enjoyed the adventure that she would have when
            we went out together.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
            Sometimes I used to take her into my home before or after a walk. My Dad was at work every day and my Mum didn’t mind Lassie
            being in the house for a while. I know that there were occasions when Lassie was in the house when Dad was there, so I think
            he realised that I had a friend that could go back home at the end of the day but that he was prepared to tolerate in small
            doses. I do remember that he never patted or greeted Lassie. He acknowledged that she was part of my life, but (although he
            didn’t dislike animals) he just wasn’t affectionate over them. One day Lassie was round our house and Dad was home. Dad and
            I were playing and we were standing facing each other and I had my hands out and Dad put his hands either side of mine and
            clapped my hands together. We did that a few times and it is the only time that I saw Lassie try to protect me. She obviously
            thought my Dad was attacking me because she jumped up and tried to separate us.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
            I can remember grooming Lassie. I didn’t have any equipment at all, but every so often I remember that she had all this fluffy
            fur that would start to come out in clumps. So I would take her into the garden, lay her down and then “pluck” the fur out with
            my fingers. I used to love the transformation from a slightly paler looking fluffy dog to a tidier, darker golden coat again.
            Lassie was very patient and didn’t seem to mind me doing this. She was the most beautiful dog and I will never forget her.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
            We grew up together, Lassie and I. As she got older I sometimes only went and sat with Claude and Dorothy for a chat and
            didn’t walk Lassie. Sometimes I would take her just up the road and back as she began to have problems with her legs. To be
            quite honest, although I knew she was old, I don’t think I ever thought about her dying. One day I went across the road and
            knocked on the door as usual and Claude came to the door. One look at him and I knew something was wrong. Lassie had been
            put to sleep earlier that day. I remember my Mum and Dad were out that evening and I didn’t want to go back to an empty
            house, so I went to another neighbour that I knew well and stayed with them for the evening until my Mum and Dad came home.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
            The one thing I regret is that I was never given the chance to say goodbye to Lassie. I would have liked one last cuddle
            and one last promise to love her forever and one last kiss on that beautiful head of hers. However, I am sure she knows
            that. She gave me the greatest gift of all, the love of a dog – thank you Lassie.
      &lt;/p&gt;
