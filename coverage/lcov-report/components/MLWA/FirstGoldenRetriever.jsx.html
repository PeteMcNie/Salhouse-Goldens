        &lt;h3&gt;First Golden Retriever - &lt;a href='/phoenix'&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Over the next couple of weeks Rob and I went for our usual weekend walks, but they weren’t the same. There was no
            bundle of joy running ahead and in and out of the bushes. No-one to throw sticks in the river for, although we did
            throw some in after she died as we imagined Pepper’s spirit would be there, swimming after them and bringing them
            back. Even now I occasionally throw a stick in the river for Pepper. But walking wasn’t such fun now. We decided
            that we wanted another dog and this time I was determined to try and find a Golden Retriever as that was what I
            had really wanted all along. I still didn’t know anything about contacting a Golden Retriever Club. I didn’t even
            know they existed, so relied on scanning the papers. I started to buy Trade and Exchange, which I had never heard
            of but someone said I might find a dog in there, and almost straight away I saw an advert for Golden Retriever
            puppies. My heart was racing when I phoned up to ask if there were any left and how much. Yes, there was one bitch
            left but I would have to go over the hill and select it and pay a deposit as soon as possible.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            My second son, Peter, and I went the following day. It was about an hour’s drive from us. There was a litter of ten
            puppies and they were about 4 weeks old. There were two female puppies to choose from as the other person who had
            booked one hadn’t arrived yet. So Peter and I cuddled these two little puppies and we decided on the lightest coloured
            one. She had a band put round her neck with our name on and we went home very happy. We had been discussing names for
            our puppy and had looked some up somewhere. Pepper had died on 9 January and these puppies were born on 10 January.
            So Peter and I decided that Phoenix would be a very good name for this puppy as it was a name we liked and also we
            considered that Phoenix had risen on the 10th out of the ashes of Pepper. (I know Pepper was buried, not cremated,
            but the idea was there.)
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;Image src="images/babyPhoenix.jpg" fluid /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            And therein lies the story of how I finally got myself my first purebred Golden Retriever.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            This dog was going to be treated differently though. I had learnt a lot from my mistakes with Pepper and I told Rob
            when I first got this dog that things were going to be different. This one was going to be a house dog, no kennel.
            She was also going to have access to all of the house, not just a rug on the lounge floor. I was going to make up to
            Pepper’s memory all the things I felt I did wrong with her.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            So we let Phoenix into our lives, and into our hearts. Its fair to say that although I was attached to Pepper, the
            boys never were really as they would get nipped if they tried to stroke her, and Rob, although he liked her felt
            that she was just a dog, probably because of his upbringing on the farm. They were all sad when she died, but the
            connection wasn’t there.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            But this puppy was different. She was beautiful and gentle and just so, so cute. I took her outside to go to the
            toilet and said “do tinkle” as she went and she came to know to go to the toilet on cue. This was one of the things
            I had never done with Pepper and the reason I kept her outside – because I never knew when she had been and was
            always afraid she would go in the house.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            We had met one of the other owners when we were picking Phoenix up, and we took their phone number as they lived
            in the same town as us. We got together quite often when the dogs were puppies and had such fun watching them play
            together. They were brother and sister, Jake and Phoenix, and loved each other.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            One day they were round our house and it was warm but had been raining. We sat inside having morning tea while these
            two ruffians played outside. They got absolutely soaked and filthy, but boy did they have fun.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;Image src="images/phoenixAndJake.jpg" fluid /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Of course, the excitement of getting Phoenix helped me through a difficult time after the loss of Pepper. I had cried
            every day after Pepper died and wondered whether I would ever feel the same again. Then, when we got Phoenix, I began
            to recover but still thought of Pepper all the time. But there were good times again with a dog and that was the most
            important thing. The soul was contented again.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Rob and I took to walking this beautiful creature and loving having her trotting along with us. However, as I am
            always thinking (and I wish I wasn’t) I used to think when I was out on a walk with Phoenix that I never wanted to
            feel that empty feeling again after losing a dog. I began to wonder whether it would be a good idea to have two dogs,
            that way if one died, you would still have the other one to keep you going. Poor Rob had to go through all my ummings
            and ahhings and he has supported me 100% through just about everything. I think he began to “fall” for Phoenix, as
            did the kids who had a much more hands on role with her – from Peter giving her the name to just the fact that they
            could play with her any time they liked because she wasn’t a nipper and just enjoyed people. My three boys are gentle
            themselves, although they have their moments as brothers do, but they seemed to know how to play with Phoenix gently.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            A bond grew between her and the family and we let her into our lives totally. She has the run of the house, although
            we put her out in the run when we went to work. She was and still is only truly happy when she is with her people.
            Rob built a special bigger run for Phoenix with a kennel. She had lots of blankets and toys that she could chew when
            we were out at work. I worked part-time so was not out for the whole day. However, Phoenix seemed to become almost
            claustrophobic and didn’t seem to want to be in the run. She would tremble when we put her in and only be happy when
            we got home. One day I got home and there was blood in the run. I found that she had obviously tried to get out and
            climbed up the chicken-wire netting. Her back claws had obviously got caught and she had ripped several of the nails
            off leaving the quicks exposed. I had to treat her by bathing her feet and trying to keep the boys&amp;apos; old football socks
            on them for a few days until the quicks hardened.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;Image src="images/peterandNix1.jpg" fluid /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            After that Phoenix was not shut in the run but left in the back garden as we had fenced off the back of our property
            by then. However, if it rained, Phoenix would still not go into the kennel and ended up getting soaking wet by the
            time I got home. This would happen no matter what time of the year it was, so if it was winter and cold, she would
            end up cold and wet.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            In the meantime, while we were out walking Phoenix and Jake at the river one day, we saw a lady walking on the
            other side of the river with what looked like three Golden Retrievers. I said to Liz, Jake’s owner, I wonder if she
            breeds them. Liz said she would call out, so she did. The lady said yes and gave her name to look up in the phone
            book. I was quite excited about this because I was definitely thinking of purchasing another Golden at this time.
            In the evening I got up the courage to phone this lady. Once again, when these obviously important times for me happen,
            my heart was in my mouth and I was very nervous, not knowing what this lady would say. However, I called. Her name was
            Sandy and I have never regretted making that phone call since. She was one of the nicest people I have ever met and I
            am still a good friend with her today. She talked to me that day about the importance of owning a Golden for the right
            reason, for realising the potential for inherited problems and the ability to be able to give your dog the best home
            and the best care. This was a far cry from the lady who I bought Phoenix off of who seemed to just want to get rid of
            the puppies as soon as she could. I had brought Phoenix home at five and a half weeks of age. I was led by the breeder
            who said that the puppies were ready. I now know that 8 weeks is a much better age for puppies to leave their “nest”.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;hr /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
